# Word-Guess
Word guess is a command line game using "inquirer". It has the same rules essentially as hangman,
which means the user must chose one letter at a time and the computer will then tell the user 
if the letter guessed is in the word or if the users guess is wrong. The user is allowed to be wrong seven times
before they lose and then they are prompted to either play again or end the game.

# Getting Started
An individual must have access to the following technologies to use/play Word-Guess:
        Internet access
        Visual Studio Code
        Terminal(Mac)/GitBash(PC)
        JavaScript
        Node.js
        npm package "inquirer"

# Prerequisites
If the user does not have VS code installed they may do so by going online and searching for Visual Studio Code and downloading the 
freeware: https://code.visualstudio.com/
After opening VS code create a new folder and name it "Word-Guess", then create three files and save name them the following;
"index.js", "letter.js", "word.js", "list.js" (The 'js' will format the file for JavaScript code).
Once the user has created the folder and files they may either copy and paste the code from Github or write their own code with the
same primary functions and goals of the application in mind. 

# Issues
I am having difficulty getting my else statement in my guessLetter function to operate. I have hit a bump there and will need some time to figure it out.
